# Skiena's book [The algorithm design manual](https://www.algorist.com/) algorithm examples

## Languages used so far

* Rust
* Ocaml

## Desirable properties of an algorithm

* Correct
* Efficient
* Easy to implement

In a real world application we know that this is not always
achievable, so having an algorithm that provides a good
enough output without slowing down the entire application
is often acceptable, regardless of whether a better
algorithm exists.
